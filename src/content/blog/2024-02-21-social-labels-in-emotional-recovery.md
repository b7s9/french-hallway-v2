The purpose of a social label that you adopt in the process of healing can serve a few main purposes:

1. Connect with other people like you, so you feel less alone
1. Connect with ideas, to aid in your self-understanding, and change your perceptions or environment
1. Connect with resources/accommodations to make surviving/thriving easier

Common labels in recovery include, CPTSD, Autism, ADHD, and more. Rememher that the goal of healing is to improve your quality of life. You may not need to adopt a label as a part of your global/central social identity to gain value from communities around the labels. 

The biggest pitfall to be aware of is using a label as a means of weaponized incompetence. Don't misunderstandâ€”I am all for trying to lessen the amount of required labor for survival. It is also important to educate others of your boundaries/limits. However, you need to recognize your own autonomy and responsibility in dealing with discomfort. If someone doesn't understand how to communicate with you, start from a place of compassion, not defensiveness.
