## From the Book

> Buildings, and especially houses, with a graceful transition between the street and the inside, are more tranquil than those which open directly off the street.

The authors discuss an argument that users tend to wear a mindset and behaviors (ie. personality) specific to existing on a street, and that existing in your building requires a shift in personality. What this pattern offers is a slight change of atmosphere, so the user can shed their street personality more easily.

This can be achieved through change in view, angle/direction sound, light, water/nature, surface material, or level (height).

Sub-patterns: Zen view (134), Garden Wall (173), Tapestry of Light and Dark (135), Trellised Walk (174), Entrance Room (130), Intimacy Gradient (127)

## Applications to Software Design

I work in digital product, so the first component springing to mind is the login screen. 

As users flit around the web from search engines to landing pages, they are wearing a web surfer personality, similar to the street personality. I'll write about that personality more in a separate post about pathway patterns.

The login screen is not the Main Entrance (110). The role here is to transition the user into the product. The authors focus on calming the user before entering the home, which works for some software products intended to be easy and low effort (eg. Netflix). 

I work in an education product where the user will have to work a bit to get value out of it. In this case, my entrance transition should feel more similar to an office or airportâ€”invoking bit of discomfort to agitate the user to be more awake and make better choices. 

That being said, there are products that come to mind like Dovetail, which seem to have design principles intended to make the product feel like a zen garden, despite the high user effort required to get value. Their login screen is very calming.

An interesting example is Hotjar's login screen which displays event marketing on the right hand side. It may be an effective means of lead generation, but may detract from the efficacy of the transition, thus cheapening the feeling that this is a high quality product.

The other consideration for digital products is privacy/security. There is some necessary agitation to authenticate the user, and hopefully wake them up enough to user secure password hygiene if registering for the first time. Otherwise I'd hope users are using a password manager and the interaction cost should be low for them.
