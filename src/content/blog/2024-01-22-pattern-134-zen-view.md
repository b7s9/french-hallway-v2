## From the Book

> If there is a beautiful view, don't spoil it by building huge windows that gape incessantly at it. Instead, put the windows which look onto the view at places of transition—along paths, in hallways, in entry ways, on stairs, between rooms.

While reading about this pattern I initially disagreed with the authors—"of course if I had access to beautiful mountain vistas, I would want my rooms to have massive windows to permit me to feel the joy of it all the time." On the surface, Biophilic Design seems to advocate for this maximalist invitation of natural beauty and joy into the building. But, I think the authors are referring specifically to large natural vistas, whereas "nature in the space" could be much smaller scale. A collection of potted plants may feel grounding, whereas the sensation of a snow-capped mountain, may feel overwhelming.

People are not capable of feeling joy *all the time*—nor should we. Sadness, anger, disgust, and anxiety are necessary parts of life. Additionally, people are not capable of multitasking states of being/mind. If I am doing labor, I should be focused on my work, then take appropriate breaks to shift my emotions/consciousness on the beautiful vista by moving myself to a different part of the room. The essence of Zen is that we should pendulate naturally between states of being, which is in stark contrast to the values of modern late capitalism, which incentivizes trying (and inevitably failing) to split our attention.

## Applied to Software Design

I would be so lucky if I were to have content in my system that I could call a "beautiful vista". Users typically do not want to self-actualize or just be present with the content of my systems. As a designer for an education product, I am building a system that users want to get tangible value out of, to achieve a goal such as being able to diagnose a patient more accurately. Thus, I'm not sure how much this pattern applies to me today. 

Perhaps in video game design, where users are more likely to be interested in self-actualization, would this pattern be more useful. In gaming, mechanics typically follow a predictable loop: 

1. Present the user with an attractive goal
1. Present engaging obstacles towards the goal
1. Reward the user for reaching the goal

If the user is always doing the most joyful activity all the time, then they have no breaks to appreciate the joy they've just experienced. 

Another relevant example may be monolithic social media apps like Instagram. These systems are the huge gaping windows in question from earlier. They are designed to be a constant flood of beauty/joy such that the only break a user gets is by closing the app entirely. So how come the joy users receive from observing the vista doesn't decline? Simple: the vista may change next time a user open the app.
