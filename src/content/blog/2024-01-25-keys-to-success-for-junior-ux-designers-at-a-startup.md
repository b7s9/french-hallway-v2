The style of design and research that you're taught at university is a bit more academic than what you'll experience on the job.

## Clarify Your Goals

How is the business going to measure the success of your labor? Is there a certain usability metric the design should achieve? Remember that a failed project is not one where you don't meet your goals, but one where no one can learn from the results. 

If your company does not measure UX in any tangible way, consider creating a metric via something like a Customer Satisfaction survey (CSAT), Monthly Active Users (MAU), or some key metric to your product such as number of videos watched. It doesn't need to be perfect, just some kind of baseline that you can observe longitudinally. 

Sometimes you'll have a task because an expensive client asked for a feature and you just need to deliver it. Sometimes a task shows up in your backlog with no context. Before you put any energy into it, ask where the request came from and why. Sometimes the answer to that is "because the CEO said so" and you'll just have to accept that and run with it. The sooner you do, the sooner you can get back to working on more interesting things.

## Embrace Pragmatism

This isn't to say that you should abandon all semblance of UX principles, and never advocate for taking extra time for design or research, but most of the time you are working on very tight deadlines to slightly improve a shitty experience that you've been handed. It is not your job to deliver Apple-levels of pristine usability and aesthetics. It is your job to deliver a feature or fix for good-enough UX.

## Stick to the Roadmap

It is the Product Manager's job to set the vision for the product and balance all the company priorities against the budget for the year. You should advocate where you can for improvements to usability, but do not stake your emotional well-being on this. As you gain comfort with the product and company culture, you will learn (via mistakes!) how to best make an impact on the roadmap. Depending on your tasks, you will have room to make small improvements here or there, but be careful not try and radically expand the scope of what the dev team is delivering on. 

## Mix Qualitative and Quantitative Methods

Qual is really good both for generating ideas and creating compelling case studies for other stakeholders at the organization. Quant is good for showing behavior patterns at scale, hopefully in a way you can connect to subscription renewal patterns. 

Most established companies rely heavily on quant analytics data. My company is uniquely focused on qual feedback since we collected it from so many different sources. If someone at the company is pushing unreasonably hard on developing a feature 

## Use your intuition

If your login page takes five seconds to load, don't bother running a whole usability study on it. You know that page needs to load faster since it is a critical touchpoint of the product. Raise a flag to investigate improving load times on that page.

## Create Priority in Your Roadmap Suggestions

Even if you need to do this arbitrarily because you can't decide which is more important, narrowing down your list not only makes you appear more confident, but is much easier for other stakeholders to understand and act on.

## Learn to Define Requirements

## Be confident sharing in-progress work

This only works if your company has a culture of actually recognizing work that is in progress and treating it as such. Startups don't often have the budget to invest in lengthy R&D projects with no positive outcome, so any time you're working on a longer project, keep checking in to make sure you're on trackâ€”and more importantly, that the priorities haven't shifted since you initially defined the requirements.
