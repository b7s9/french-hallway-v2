For the past few years I've been fascinated by Biophilic Design as defined by these authors:

- [The Practice of Biophilic Design](https://www.biophilic-design.com/) - Stephen R. Kellert & Elizabeth F. Calabreseâ€‹
- [14 Patterns of Biophilic Design](https://www.terrapinbrightgreen.com/reports/14-patterns/) - William Browning, Catherine Ryan, Joseph Clancy

The general idea is to build spaces that feel human and connected to the earth.

The articles have perfect illustrations of concepts, so I won't try to improve on it, but just summarize here, followed by my thoughts on how to apply these principles to software design.

## Categories

Both articles agree on the following:

1. Nature in the space - eg. light, air, plants, water, etc.
1. Natural analogues - eg. organic patterns, natural colors or materials
1. Nature of the space - eg. wayfinding, emotional safety, risk perception
