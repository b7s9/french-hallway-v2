## Pattern no. 123: Pedestrian Density

### From the Book

> Many of our modern public squares, though intended as lively plazas, are in fact deserted and dead.

Liveliness of a public area is measured in square feet per square person. The proposed target is 150/sfpp, (range 100-300 ish) so the area feels alive. If the area is more than 1000/sfpp, then the public place may feel dead. The authors note that time plays an important factor hereâ€”a plaza may be expected to be dead in the morning and alive at night.

Depending on the scenario, the architect may want a more lively or dead space. But this pattern is assuming a public park or similar. Indoor spaces like music venues would be preferred to be more dense and more alive.

### Applied to Software Design

The most apparent example that springs to mind is the design density of a social media feed, for instance Mastadon or micro.blog. We could measure density in a few ways:

1. posts per hour (concept)
2. posts per viewport height (literal)

Perhaps the combination of the two is what gives a social media app the feeling of aliveness. I would consider feelings of reality/authenticity to be related to this pattern, but distinct, as it is most definitely possible for a social forum to be alive and full of garbage.
