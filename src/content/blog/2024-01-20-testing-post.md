Welcome to French Hallway. I made this site in 24 hours. I plan to use it to keep track of ideas I have about design and social psychology.

If you want to follow along, you will need to follow the [RSS Feed](/rss.xml) using an RSS reader app. There are tons out there for $0 and no ads. Some will take payment if you want to sync across devices or turn newsletters into rss feeds. I personally use Net NewsReader (ios/mac only). Other good options include Feedbin or Feedly. It would cost me at least $10 a month to do an email newsletter, for all of the 3 people who will read this.

The only thing that makes me nervous about the current architecture is that it would be easy for Google to crawl it and train its LLM product with my data. I won't be posting anything too personal for that reason, and I may disallow google bot traffic for that reason. If I do that it means you'll need a direct link to access my site, since it wouldn't be on traditional search engines. I could still submit it to indie search engines. In any case, I'll think on that if I actually end up using this regularly. 

I set up a basic content management system so theoretically I can write posts from anywhere, including my phone, but we'll see how well that actually works. Should be fun!
