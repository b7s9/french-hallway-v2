[Searching for Humanity in a Battle Royale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SArtgoMMDNg), a 30 min. youtube video.

Pop Culture Detective did primary research to see how many other players of the popular battle royale game Fortnite, would drop their weapons and just hang out. He found that many users embraced pacifism when presented with the right combination of disarming dance moves.

The argument of the essay is that despite the core game mechanics heavily incentivizing violence, the desire for human connection is not difficult to cultivate. The point is underscored by the mechanic Fortnite introduced to have driveable cars and petrol stations, where users could act as taxi drivers and station attendants, for no in-game reward, but for the pleasure of helping other people.

I'm sure this youtube channel is not the first to make statements about nature vs. nurture, but I thought the case study was very well illustrated.
