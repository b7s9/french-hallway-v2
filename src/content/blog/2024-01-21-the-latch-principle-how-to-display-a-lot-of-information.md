description: A theory on content organization for discovery, especially search results.

Displaying a lot of information in a content discovery use case (eg. Browse, Search, Feeds), is a tricky task. Often the most "powerful" feeling searches will offer a combination of the following filters/sorts. It is your responsibility as the designer to know the best default for your product, and to what degree the other filters may be necessary.

* L = Location. aka Source or Author.
* A = Alphabetical
* T = Time. Recent/Old/Significant periods
* C = Category. Sibling relationships
* H = Hierarchy. Parent child relationships

## Location

Geographic Information tends to be most useful in products with a massive amount of data, eg. browsing new albums by city on Bandcamp

...or where the use case is specifically about physical movement or location, eg. Google maps

## Category

This refers to a peer category system such as "categories", typically more rigid, and defined by the product designer

...or tags, which are typically more free-form, and may be defined by the user/content author.
