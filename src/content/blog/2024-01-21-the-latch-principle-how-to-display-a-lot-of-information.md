Displaying a lot of information in a content discovery use case (eg. Browse, Search, Feeds), is a tricky task. Often the most "powerful" feeling searches will offer a combination of the following filters/sorts. It is your responsibility as the designer to know the best default for your product, and to what degree the other filters may be necessary.

* L = Location. aka Source or Author.
* A = Alphabetical
* T = Time. Recent/Old/Significant periods
* C = Category. Sibling relationships
* H = Hierarchy. Parent child relationships
