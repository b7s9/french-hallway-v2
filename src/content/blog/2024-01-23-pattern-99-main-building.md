## From the Book

> For any collection of buildings, decide which building [...] houses the most essential functionâ€”which building is the soul of the group, as a human institution. Then, form this building as the main building, with a central position, higher roof.

I think what the authors miss is that building complexes naturally evolve over time. Even without the pressures of capitalism, social groups having changing needs as the environment or culture changes. Thus, buildings will lose or gain function as activities go in and out of demand. Similarly, the size of the group using the building complex may significantly grow or shrink years after the construction is finished, thus stimulating construction or demolition/re-design. It is possible for the very soul of the institution to change.

## Applied to Software Design

Digital systems are in a unique position here because it is much easier to rebuild software than an entire physical complex of buildings. Thus, if a business suddenly acquires a few companies, it is not too difficult to re-design the main landing page to be a better jumping off point for each new product in the portfolio. 

The main building is not necessarily the main entrance though. For digital products, the main building should be the house of the key feature(s) for the key audience. But this might make the most sense when there is a large set of features at play, which could be viewed as separate "buildings". On my design team we typically call these "apps". 

For instance, we have our main product app, where the bulk of our education content lives, thus users spend most of their time discovering and consuming content. We have separate buildings where marketing can bring users into the main app via assorted entrances. We also have a separate product app for b2b functionality. This other product app has limited scope, limited audience, and we don't expect those users to spend much time there, thus it would be ridiculous to position it as the "soul" of our offerings and thus the main building. It will be accessible through our family of entrances, via an offshoot path.

### Examples

I will do some research in my reference library

Modular apps like Ableton or the Google/Microsoft Suites. Google Drive feels like a main building, whereas the Adobe license manager just feels like an administrative office.
