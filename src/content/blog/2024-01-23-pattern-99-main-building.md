## From the Book

> For any collection of buildings, decide which building [...] houses the most essential functionâ€”which building is the soul of thre group, as a human institution. Then, form this building as the main building, with a central position, higher roof.

I think what the authors miss is that building complexes naturally evolve over time. Even without the pressures of capitalism, social groups having changing needs as the environment or culture changes. Thus, buildings will lose or gain function as activities go in and out of demand. Similarly, the size of the group using the building complex may significantly grow or shrink years after the construction is finished, thus stimulating construction or demolition/re-design. It is possible for the very soul of the institution to change.

Part of: Building Complex (95), Circulation Realms (98)

Components: Common Areas at the Heart (129), Cascade of Roofs, (116), Family of Entrances (102), Structure Follows Social Spaces (205)

## Applied to Software Design

Digital systems are in a unique position here because it is much easier to rebuild software than an entire physical complex of buildings. Thus, if a business suddenly acquires a few companies, it is not too difficult to re-design the main landing page to be a better jumping off point for each new product in the portfolio.

### Examples

I will do some research in my reference library
