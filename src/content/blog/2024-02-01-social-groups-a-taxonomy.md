This is the first draft of a framework I have been working on for a few years, and will likely be refining for the rest of my life.

The purpose is to help people with complex trauma backgrounds to enter/re-enter society. A question I frequently see on forums is that people feel like they have done enough personal emotional work to start making connections, but have no idea how to do so, or what to try. This framework is partly inspiration and partly a guide for how to join groups and evaluate them as to how they contribute to well-being. 

## Group Activity Types

1. Individual craft (writing, photography)
2. Collective craft (theater, band, dance)
3. Skill/Strength based competition (sports and games)
4. Organization towards a goal (volunteering, activism, work)
5. Affinity group with no goal (forums, friends, lovers)

## Quality Evaluation Measures

1. **Joy** (Am I having fun?)
2. **Safety** (Can I express my thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment? Can I be my authentic self?)
3. **Growth** (Am I learning/being challenged?)

## Other

**Dual Relationships** – Let's say your romantic partner regularly joins you for a weekly screen printing class. Eventually you both develop friends in that group. If at some point you go through a rough patch with your partner and you want to rely more heavily on your other groups for your attachment needs, the painting class could be complicated and feel potentially unsafe since your partner has stake in that group as well. This phenomenon is how close-knit university friend groups can be destroyed by in-dating.

## Further Research

I had my first research interview recently. Between that and some other literature I've read, one aspect missing from my framework is Identity. Identity isn't something I've considered as deeply due to my generally falling within the protection of being a white middle class cishét man, with a somewhat mainstream cultural heritage. Identity might be pretty similar to safety/vulnerability, but might be its own category altogether.
