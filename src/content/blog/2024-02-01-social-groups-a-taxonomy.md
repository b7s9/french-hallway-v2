## Group Activity Types

1. Individual craft (writing, photography)
2. Collective craft (theater, band, dance)
3. Skill/Strength based competition (sports and games)
4. Organization towards a goal (volunteering, activism, work)
5. Affinity group with no goal (forums, friends, lovers)

## Quality Evaluation Measures

1. **Joy** (Am I having fun?)
2. **Safety** (Can I express my thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment? Can I be my authentic self?)
3. **Growth** (Am I learning/being challenged?)

This phenomenon is how close-knit university friend groups can be destroyed by in-dating.
